## Project Overview

Given an image of a dog, this model will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

I have experimented with three architectures for this project.

- CNN from Scratch
- Transfer learning using VGG-16
- Transfer learning using Resnet50

All the code and results are can be seen in the [notebook](https://github.com/think-data/Dog-Breed-Classification/blob/master/dog_app.ipynb)
